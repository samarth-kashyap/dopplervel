Processing of HMI Dopplergrams to produce the convective power spectrum
for radial, toroidal and poloidal flows.

* Pre-processing of raw images - The raw images obtained from JSOC corresponding to the series /hmi.V_720s/
* Spectral processing of pre-processed images using healPy.
* Inverting processed spectra to estimate the true spectra
